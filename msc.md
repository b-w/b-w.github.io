# Master of Science

> â€” _Only Won_

I acquired the degree of Master of Science (MSc) from [Eindhoven University of Technology](http://www.tue.nl/), in the field of Computer Science and Engineering, with a specialization in Databases and Hypermedia. The topic for my master's thesis is "A Framework for Query Optimization on Value-based RDF Indexes". My advisor was [dr. George Fletcher](http://www.win.tue.nl/~gfletche/). I successfully defended my thesis on February 27, [2013](http://www.win.tue.nl/lotgevallen/msc-cse.htm#2013). The project was graded 9 out of 10.

My thesis is available for reading [at the TU/e online library](http://alexandria.tue.nl/extra1/afstversl/wsk-i/wolff2013.pdf) (PDF file / 1,37 MB).

The code for my implementation of TripleT is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/b-w/TripleT).
