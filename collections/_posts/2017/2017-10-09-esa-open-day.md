So, I attended the [ESA Open Day](http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESTEC/Open_day_2017) this year, at ESTEC in Noordwijk (The Netherlands).

As someone with a casual interest in astronomy, I suppose it was inevitable that I would visit ESA eventually, especially considering it's only a 1,5 hour drive away from where I live.

I brought my camera, along with my new 10-20mm lens, in order to take some pictures. The wide-angle lens turned out to be a great choice, as it really let me capture the scale of some of ESA's larger facilities. You can see some selected shots [here]({% link stuff/photo/2017/esa.md %}). As usual my photographer's eye was drawn more to the architecture of the place than to the actual exposition itself. And even though it was extremely crowded everywhere, there's not a single person in any of my shots. Just the way I like it.
