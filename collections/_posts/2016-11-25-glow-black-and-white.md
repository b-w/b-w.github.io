I posted some of my [GLOW photos]({% post_url 2016-11-19-glow-impressions %}) the other week. I think they turned out alright and I was going to leave it at that. But then [someone](http://www.diemwolff.com/) went ahead and suggested that some of those shots might look better in black and white. And... they do. Well, sometimes, at least. This has been a bit of an experiment for me, and I haven't quite decided yet on whether I like the results. Regardless, here are some of my GLOW shots, in black and white:
