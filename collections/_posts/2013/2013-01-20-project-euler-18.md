Here's another Euler problem for you!

I have a feeling this will be interesting. And no, we won't be brÃ¼te-forcing this one. We will be using C#. I've started by placing the large triangle in a text file, aligned like so:

> 75  
> 95 64  
> 17 47 82  
> 18 35 87 10  
> 20 04 82 47 65  
> 19 01 23 75 03 34  
> 88 02 77 73 07 63 67  
> 99 65 04 28 06 16 70 92  
> 41 41 26 56 83 40 80 70 33  
> 41 48 72 33 47 32 37 16 94 29  
> 53 71 44 65 25 43 91 52 97 51 14  
> 70 11 33 28 77 73 17 78 39 68 17 57  
> 91 71 52 38 17 14 91 43 58 50 27 29 48  
> 63 66 04 68 89 53 67 30 73 16 69 87 40 31  
> 04 62 98 27 23 09 70 98 73 93 38 53 60 04 23

We'll then proceed to read the thing into an array:

```csharp
var triangle = new int[15, 15];

using (var sr = new StreamReader("problem-18.txt"))
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 15; i++)
    {
        var line = sr.ReadLine().Split(' ');
        for (int j = 0; j < i + 1; j++)
        {
            triangle[i, j] = Int32.Parse(line[j]);
        }
    }
}
```

Just to be clear, the top of the triangle (value 75) is in position _[0, 0]_ in the array, with _[0, 1]_ to _[0, 14]_ being empty. Now that we've got this high-tech datastructure set up, we can start solving the problem. We'll do so by propagating all possible maximal paths down the tree, like so:

![Euler problem 18](/assets/img/blog/2013/01/euler-018-1.png)

When we are on some layer, we need to propagate the largest possible values down to the layer below in order to continue the maximal path. In any of the nodes aside from those on the edges, this involves making a choice between the two nodes directly above it.

![Euler problem 18](/assets/img/blog/2013/01/euler-018-2.png)

In the image above, we can get to the 4 node via a path leading trough the 10 node or a path leading through the 7 node. Obviously, the path leading through the 10 node results in the larger value, namely 14 versus 11 otherwise. So, when we propagate the maximal paths down the tree, every node ends up containing the sum of the maximal path leading up to it. In the general case, a propagation step of a layer _i_ looks like the following:

![Euler problem 18](/assets/img/blog/2013/01/euler-018-3.png)

The two nodes on the edges, _[i+1, 0]_ and _[i+1, j+1]_, must take their values from the edge nodes of the layer above. For any of the nodes in between, there is a choice. Node _[i+1, k+1]_ will take its value from either node _[i, k]_ or _[i, k+1]_ from the layer above. We will always choose whichever node has the highest value. The following code performs the propagation steps:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 14; i++)
{
    // next line, outer left
    triangle[i + 1, 0] += triangle[i, 0];

    // next line, outer right
    triangle[i + 1, i + 1] += triangle[i, i];

    for (int j = 0; j < i; j++)
    {
        // next line, shared child
        triangle[i + 1, j + 1] += Math.Max(triangle[i, j], triangle[i, j + 1]);
    }
}
```

When it is finished, the bottom nodes all contain the value of the maximal path leading up to it. Now all that remains is going through each one and finding the maximal value among them:

```csharp
var max = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 15; i++)
{
    if (triangle[14, i] > max)
        max = triangle[14, i];
}
Console.WriteLine(max);
```

This number is then the maximal total from top to bottom in the triangle.
