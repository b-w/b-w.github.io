I visited [GLOW](http://www.gloweindhoven.nl/) for the first time this year. My expectations were high, and while there were some beautiful projects to behold, there wasn't anything that made me go "wow". Still, it was a nice way to spend my Friday evening. I'll definitely visit again next year.

My main reason for attending was to take photos. Surprisingly, I did manage to take a handful of shots that I'm not entirely dissatisfied with. I'm showcasing those here. About half the photos actually feature GLOW projects, though they're all taken along the GLOW route.

All photos are taken by me, using my Nikon D5300 and Nikkor 35mm f/1.8\. I shot hand-held only. Post-processing was done in RawTherapee.
