I've got Google Analytics running on my site, because I'm curious about the traffic I get. 2017 has been the first full year I've had GA running, so I figured I'd take some time to look back at how the last year has been from the perspective of my website.

## Views

First thing: pageviews. My site isn't exactly popular, which is fine by me—I mostly maintain it just because I like doing it. Still, in 2017 GA recorded a grand total of 13.178 pageviews.

About 75% of visitors are "new sessions", with the remaining 25% being returning visitors. The average session views 1,4 pages and lasts 49 seconds. I'm not sure how GA measures any of this, but there you go.

## Demographics

I have a fairly international audience: 115 different countries are represented, from all over the world.

The overwhelming majority of visitors are from the US: roughly 1/3rd. The other 9 countries from the top 10 make up another 3rd of the total. Which means the remaining 33% of visitors are spread over the remaining 105 countries.

## Pages

The most popular page, by a huge margin, has been [the article I've written]({% post_url 2017-03-20-nuget-multiple-targets %}) about NuGet package creation. This single page has accounted for 46% of all pageviews in 2017\. I hope at least some of those people found it useful. Other popular pages include [the homepage]({% link index.md %}) (surprise surprise!), my [article]({% post_url 2016-12-10-ioptron-skytracker %}) about the SkyTracker, and my [series]({% post_url 2016-10-08-shenzhen-io-part-1 %}) [of]({% post_url 2016-10-12-shenzhen-io-part-2 %}) [adventures]({% post_url 2016-10-15-shenzhen-io-part-3 %}) [with]({% post_url 2016-10-17-shenzhen-io-part-4 %}) SHENZHEN I/O.

## Referrals

One of the more interesting aspects of the GA reports is the referral information. Pretty much everyone finds my site either through search (84%) or through direct links (12%), the latter meaning that no referral information is available. However, there have also been a (very) small number of referrals through Facebook (odd, since I don't use it), reddit, and GitHub. The Facebook referrals don't contain any information other than that they came from Facebook, but the other referrals do. For instance, I learned that my popular NuGet article was [submitted to reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/6octcj/targeting_multiple_net_platforms_in_a_single/) and linked in [a](https://github.com/PureKrome/HttpClient.Helpers/issues/30) [couple](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/20939) [of](https://github.com/esendex/TokenBucket/pull/4) [random](https://github.com/net-commons/common-logging/issues/148) [GitHub](https://github.com/nsubstitute/NSubstitute/issues/329) [issues](https://github.com/dmetzgar/corewf/issues/13).

## 2018

My goal with the site for 2018 is basically just to keep on truckin'. Like I said, I just do this for fun. My aim is to write roughly one blog article per month, but I really only write stuff when I feel like it so I don't know if that is going to happen. But hey: it's January 2nd right now, so the first one is in the bag! 11 more to go...
