I've changed my blog's layout from a dark simplistic style to a light simplistic style. Whether or not you consider this an upgrade or a downgrade is up to you.

Of course, the new style was not precisely to my liking, so as with the first one I've had to "rearrange" some things in the site master, the style sheet, and some other files. Luckily I still haven't completely forgotten my ASP knowledge.

Anyway, I like the way it is now. Somehow it makes the blog feel slightly less amateurish.
