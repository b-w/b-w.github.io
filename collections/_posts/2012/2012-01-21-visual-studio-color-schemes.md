Is it me, or can any piece of code be made to look better simply by viewing it in the correct color scheme?

Now, Visual Studio contains a fairly broad set of options for configuring how the code in your editing window is to be formatted. Problem is, it's a real laundry list of options, and going through all of them and configuring everything yourself can be quite a daunting task. Luckily there are a ton of different themes available out there, like this one:

I've wanted to change the default color scheme for my code for a while now, but all of my own attempts ended up looking like something a sick dog might throw up. So instead of spending more time on that I've been looking for a nice pre-existing theme, and recently I've stumbled across [this](http://studiostyl.es/) awesome little site containing literally hundreds of them. The theme I'm currently using is called [Son of Obsidian](http://studiostyl.es/schemes/son-of-obsidian). Not only does it look great, it's also far more readable and easier on the eyes than the default bright-white-in-your-face setting. I think I'll be sticking with this for now instead.
