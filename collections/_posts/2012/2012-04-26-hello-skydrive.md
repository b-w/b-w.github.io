title: "Goodbye, Dropbox; Hello, SkyDrive"

For the past few years I've been using two different services for storing files in the cloud: [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) and [SkyDrive](http://www.skydrive.com/). Both services had distinct advantages and disadvantages. Dropbox is very user-friendly with its app that syncs a selected folder on your PC to Dropbox's cloud and integrates perfectly with how you already manage files on your PC; on the other hand, the storage space for free users is only 2 GB. SkyDrive offers 25 GB on its free plan, but suffers from poor usability because it can't automatically sync and file management has to go through the SkyDrive website exclusively. At least, that's how it was until a few days ago.

## Enter the apps

A [blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/04/23/the-next-chapter-for-skydrive-personal-cloud-storage-for-windows-available-anywhere.aspx) from April 23rd showcases the new line of SkyDrive apps which aim to effectively solve any previous usability problems in one fell swoop. Apps exist for both Microsoft (Windows and Windows Phone) and Apple (OS X and iOS) devices. So far I've only tried the Windows app (currently still in beta) and I must say I am impressed. The comparison with Dropbox is inevitable, so let's just go through the steps of how SkyDrive works. Sing along if you know the lines:

1.  A configure-less installation after which you sign in with your account and point to a folder on your PC which will be synced.
2.  An app which starts automatically, doesn't require attention, runs in the system tray, and silently syncs your files in the background.
3.  A folder in which the files are marked with small icons to indicate their sync status.

It's pretty much exactly like Dropbox. And this is a good thing, because Dropbox is very very good. But SkyDrive takes it a step further by also offering the option of remotely browsing _all_ the files from any PC which is powered on and connected to SkyDrive, simply by signing in to the SkyDrive website. This effectively turns every PC you own into your own private file server, available from anywhere.

## More storage because more storage

I previously used SkyDrive only for backup purposes, and Dropbox for my day-to-day work because it was simply the more usable of the two. That's about to change. Now that the usability playing field has been leveled, it all comes down to storage space. And that's where SkyDrive wins, simply because it offers more. Of course, both services offer paid plans that allow you to extend your storage (with Microsoft asking about 1/4rth of what Dropbox asks for the same amount of space), but I'm only looking at free accounts for now because that's what most users are going to have.

With Dropbox you get an initial 2 GB that you can extend for free up to 18 GB using referrals, which is when someone else signs up for Dropbox via your referral. You get 500 MB extra for each referral. SkyDrive, on the other hand, currently offers a fixed 7 GB to free accounts, and Microsoft claims this is enough to satisfy the storage needs of over 99% of its users. So while theoretically Dropbox offers more space, you'll have to get at least 10 referrals just to equal SkyDrive's 7 GB, which just hands it to you without forcing you to jump through any hoops.

But what about the 25 GB which I mentioned SkyDrive offered before this change? Well, if you've ever used your SkyDrive to store any stuff before last April 22nd, you will be allowed to retain that 25 GB for free as a reward for you loyalty. That's 25 GB of free, easy to use cloud storage! I'm sorry, Dropbox, but you're going to have to go.
