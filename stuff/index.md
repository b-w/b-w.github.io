# Stuff

The internet might not be a big truck that you just dump something on, but this webzone certainly is!

## Recent(-ish) stuff

Content that I'm at least occasionally still updating:

- [3D modeling]({% link stuff/3d/index.md %}): my exploits in the field of amateur 3D modeling and rendering.

## Archived stuff

Older pages and content that is no longer being updated:

- [Photography]({% link stuff/photo/index.md %}): an archive of some of my amateur photography work. While I think I've made maybe one or two decent shots, I've since lost interest in doing photography regularly and have moved on to other hobbies.
- [Astronomy]({% link stuff/astro/index.md %}): some extremely poorly done astrophotography. My own laziness prevented me from doing more with this hobby, as doing so would have meant leaving the house.
