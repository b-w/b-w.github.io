# Hello World

Welcome to my personal website. Around here you'll find a loose collection of things that interest me, which is primarily tech-related stuff.

Professionally, I work as a C#.NET developer, mostly on backend stuff and webservices. I have an [MSc]({% link msc.md %}) in computer science & engineering. I've been fascinated by computers for as long as I can remember, and I like tinkering around with them and using them to build cool stuff.
